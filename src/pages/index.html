		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>Hiring neurodiversity people can benefit your company!</p>
		<p><mark>(Site name)</mark> is aimed to help companies to educate hiring teams on the best ways to be inclusive and conduct tech interviews to avoid missing out on qualified candidates who may learn and interact differently.</p>
		<p>Let&rsquo;s link directly to the Havard Business Review article from the home page. It&rsquo;s good and too thorough not to share in full.</p>
		<p>If you&rsquo;re a savvy IT exec or hiring professional, and you must be if you&rsquo;re here, then you&rsquo;ve likely heard a little already about this neurodiversity, or Cognitive Diversity, thing. Maybe you&rsquo;ve even read &ldquo;Neurodiversity as a Competitive Advantage&rdquo;(link) in the Harvard Business Review (HBR) and you&rsquo;re wondering, &ldquo;How can I tap into this in demand skills base?&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re not quite sure what I&rsquo;m talking about, don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll be hip to this emerging innovation by the time you leave here. More than that you&rsquo;ll learn how to bring Cognitive Diversity to your technology teams, joining the ranks of innovators like Microsoft, Ford, IBM, Chase and more (Austin and Pisano, HBR) who are seeking out this minority population and experiencing great results for their efforts.</p>
		<p>What is this Cognitive Diversity thing anyway? We&rsquo;ll start with our nearly synonymous sister term neurodiversity. &ldquo;Nurodiversity is the idea that neurological differences like Autism and ADHD are the result of normal, natural variation in the human genome&rdquo; (Robinson, Psychology Today). Neurodiverse people, like those on the Autism spectrum, with diagnosis like dyspraxia, dyslexia, ADHD and more are <em>differently abled </em>than our neurotypical peers. Cognitive Diversity, for the purposes of this site, goes a step further to include those who may identify strongly with the term <em>disability</em> and have concerns that the neurodiversity movement could inadvertently erase the very real struggles they face that other groups may not. This can include people with any of the diagnoses above and loop in those with sometimes trauma induced differences like PTSD, depression, anxiety and others. Like all populations, there isn&rsquo;t really agreement on the question of labels (we are all different after all), but imo that&rsquo;s ok.</p>
		<p>What&rsquo;s important here is this: those who are neurologically different than the majority have skills to share, strengths and weaknesses like everyone else, but the world as we all know turns for the majority. The technology sector is no different and in fact it might even be one of the worst offenders. As a result this amazing population of workers are struggling to get into the jobs for which they are most qualified. Let me say this next piece really loud so we&rsquo;re clear, &ldquo;The standard tech interview process itself, designed by and for the neurotypical mind, is keeping Cognitive Diversity out of your company&rdquo;. Our goal here at Hiring Cognitive is to help you remedy that problem.</p>
		<p><strong>On this site you will find information about:</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>How we experience ourselves as neurodivergent and what this difference has meant for us in our technology careers and our job seeking journey&rsquo;s in particular. (Link to experiences page)</li>
			<li>Ways in which we SHINE in the workforce. Why your team needs us as much as we need you. (Link to Defining Cognitive page - this page should be all about defining the pros to being divergent)</li>
			<li>And what you&rsquo;re most excited about I know - How in the world you can get us in your doors. This is where we&rsquo;re going to talk about what&rsquo;s not working in your current interview process and why and more importantly what you can do instead to court and hire Cognitively Diverse talent. (Link to Hiring page)</li>
			<li>You&rsquo;ll also find links to resources throughout. Other folks who are talking about this stuff in ways you might find helpful and useful to share within your organizations.</li>

			<h3>Defining Cognitive Diversity (why you want to hire them)</h3>
			<p><strong>What is cognitive diversity?</strong></p>
			<p>Cognitive diversity is an umbrella term for changes that occur within the brain that are considered to be normal variations. These changes allow people to process information in different and often new and creative ways. This means that cognitive diversity is largely a positive thing.</p>
			<p>It is important to have a diverse team where employees know they can easily access tools or equitable accommodations or options effectively (and without judgment). This acceptance can increase creativity, motivation, and consequently productivity. Accepting differences allows for a more equitable world. People may process, learn, remember and convey information differently.</p>
			<p>Talk specifics here. Pull from interviews and research articles. Answer the question What Makes Us Shine?</p>

			<h3>Suggestions / Tips</h3>
			<p>See the organizational flow created by Liz in Figma</p>
			<p>Candidates should be asked how to they prefer to learn/process and choose from examples or a few different options. Hiring teams should think about hiring someone because of their skills and not to be compliant with the law. People should come first than their neurodiversity and the company in a nonjudgmental and equitable environment conduct the interview to find qualified candidates that may learn differently.</p>
			<p>Everyone should have the same right to show their capabilities at work. An equity hiring process will make this possible!</p>
			<p>(maybe) walk through interview by role, and &ldquo;suggest a better process&rdquo; with each breakdown. Pull details from interviews and resource articles.</p>

			<h3>Here we have some tips to help you to conduct a better interview:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Don&rsquo;t have assignments to complete in a certain time</li>
				<li>Don&rsquo;t request the candidate to identify themselves, for example: are you proactive, etc</li>
				<li>Don&rsquo;t have excess stimulation in the room</li>
				<li>More humane process and less automated</li>
				<li>The hiring team should see the candidate&rsquo;s qualities/skills before their diversity</li>
				<li>Larger deadlines for neurodiversity candidates</li>
				<li>make the neurodivergent candidate feel confident</li>
				<li>The company needs to show the candidate that they contacted them because of the skills and not to comply with the law</li>
				<li>companies should empower people to talk more about neurodiversity</li>
				<li>Don&rsquo;t have an interview with a lot of people at the same time</li>
				<li>Don&rsquo;t interview in a noisy environment and when people are constantly moving</li>
				<li>&nbsp;video interview instead of the phone interview for the first round</li>

			<h3>Experiences</h3>
			<p>Organize interview details by applicant role. These should be narrative and about how the interviewee experiences themselves as neurodivergent and how that&rsquo;s played possibly or negatively in interviews. Leave out their suggestions here and use those on the Hiring page as a mix of quotes for emotional appeal and of more professionally organized suggestions.</p>
			<p>Preface a negative experience with subheading &ldquo;What not to do&rdquo; Link from any negative experience to the hiring page with button &ldquo;How to do it right&rdquo;. Or something to that effect.</p>
			<p>There should be a blurb in here about the qualitative research processes goals, methods etc, and an appeal to fund a much larger version of the study.</p>
